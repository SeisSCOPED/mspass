Because of roundoff error issues the automated test that runs this 
program only returns a failure if the program exits with an error 
(e.g. a seg fault).   For any major change one should look at the
results carefully to confirm the output is what is expected.   

There are two manual ways to verify the validity of the output:
1.  test_tcs.out is the output created by a certified output that
was hand checked by the author.  If there are large difference in
the numerical results digging to fix the problem is indicated.
2.  The matlab_validate.m script is an independent calculation of 
some of the output that is not obvious.   If the tests are expanded
or changed this file needs to be updated.

Note also this set of tests are not necessarily exhaustive.  There is 
enough complexity in this implementation that I (GLP) could easily 
have missed something that could be an issue.
