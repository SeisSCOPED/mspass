# Massive Parallel Analysis System for Seismologists 

MsPASS is made available through a [dockerhub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/wangyinz/mspass) that automatically builds with the Dockerfile here. 

We have the MongoDB and Spark components working for now.

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/wangyinz/mspass/wiki) page for details.
